# DIYStreamDeck
Basic DIY Stream Deck building from project by dmadison.

Building on the notion that although the Stream Deck is a very nice unit, it is expensive and far too over-speced for my needs. All I really require are a few buttons (and mabye some LED's to illuminate them). The starting point for this is a post by Dave Madison showing how he built a basic 8-button keyboard in a 3d printed enclosure. The unit is powered by a small Arduino, connects to a PC via USB and when pressed send key presses to the operating system. The unit sends the funtion keys F13 to F20 which are normally not used on keyboards and can be easily mapped within the software (e.g. OBS).

I would like to add LED features in future revisions (glow lighting and feedback for keys) and also design a new case to fit one of the risers on my desk.
